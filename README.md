# hello-world
I don't really know how to use GitHub so I'm using the guide : )
Hmmm...
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/?utm_source=onboarding-series&utm_medium=email&utm_content=hello-world-link&utm_campaign=welcome-email
^^That's the link to the guide, in case I ever lose it. 
I hope I can learn how to use GitHub properly.
