I'm getting better at github. I understand how stuff works kinda!!

Working through the GUI is still pretty hard tho. GOOEY. GUI. GOOOOO EEEE.

I love going to hackathons though. I should really try getting a team that actively uses github to share and collaborate on code.
Since doing is the best way to learning, that'll be my path to really understanding how Github works.

until then, I'll keep doing as much as I can on my own and figuring out how to collaborate with myself.
